    <h1>Little and big adventures</h1>
        <p>A chronicle of everyday adventures and the many critters, trees, and rocks I meet along the way. And some of the food I make.</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
        <p> This is mostly going to start from this point in time and move forward, but the past couple of years has also been full of exploring and discovery. So, sometimes I'll dip into adventures from before, sometimes adventures of the future, but mostly sharing adventures of now. Trying to find ways to stay connected with people and with the earth, to learn from the world around me, and to expand the boundaries of exploration.</p>
        <p> I also have a YouTube channel, which will be linked here when I figure out how, mostly featuring videos of birds and some cycling journeys.</p>
